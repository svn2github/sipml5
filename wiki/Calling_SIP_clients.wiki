#summary Calling SIP clients

sipML5 is a SIP / IMS client (RFC 3261) and can be used to call any SIP-capable device implementing all mandatory features defined by the RTCWeb working group (mainly defined in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-02 draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-02]). <br />
To ease you life, we have developed rich SIP clients for Android, iOS, Windows and MAC OS X which support these standards. The implementation is based on [http://code.google.com/p/doubango/ Doubango IMS Framework]<br />
All these rich clients contain a profile named *RTCWeb* to use to enable all mandatory features (ICE, RTCP, SRTP, AVPF...).
