#summary Calling SIP clients
#labels Featured,Phase-Support

sipML5 is a SIP / IMS client (RFC 3261) and can be used to call any SIP-capable device implementing all mandatory features defined by the RTCWeb working group (mainly defined in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-02 draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-02]). <br />
To make your life easier, we have developed rich SIP clients for *Android*, *iOS*, *Windows* and *MAC OS X* which support these standards. The implementation is based on [http://code.google.com/p/doubango/ Doubango IMS Framework]<br />
All these rich clients contain a profile named *RTCWeb* to use to enable all mandatory features (ICE, RTCP, SRTP, AVPF, RTCP-MUX...).

==Windows==
The Windows(XP, Vista, 7) rich client is named [http://code.google.com/p/boghe/ Boghe] and can be downloaded from [http://code.google.com/p/boghe/ here]. <br />
To enable RTCWeb features: Tools -> Options -> General -> Media Profile -> RTCWeb.
