==Which operating systems are supported?==
Any System supporting a web browser (Chrome, firefox, Safari or IE) built with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> features.
We highly recommend using <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a>

==Is it possible to call another HTML5 SIP client==
Yes

==Is it possible to call any SIP client?==
Yes... but the client must support all standards defined by the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/">RTCWeb</a> working group. We recommend these clients:
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boghe/">Boghe</a> _2.0.100.701_ or later : Windows XP, Vista and 7
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/p/imsdroid/">IMSDroid</a> _2.0.491_ or later: Android
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/p/idoubs/">iDoubs</a>: iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch) and MAC OSX
...off course you don't need to install these applications if you are calling another HTML5 SIP client. <br />
For more information on how to configure these clients, please [Calling_SIP_clients click here]. <br />
